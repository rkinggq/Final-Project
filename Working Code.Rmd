#CPK: Changed this bc I'm not using your computer (you should too!). AND!!! Look at what the file paths DON'T contain, i.e., how is stars to read in a file in a folder that you haven't told it it's in?

  st_crop(nh_filtered)#CPK: this causes an error, but bc you're intersecting so few data, the downsample is unnned %>%
  #st_downsample(factor = 5, FUN = mean)

#CPK: my advice would be to run a for loop or lapply to read in each year and combine to one big sf dataframe.
