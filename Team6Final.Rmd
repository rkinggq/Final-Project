# Methods 

To visualize the geographic focus of the study, spatial data for New Hampshire's political boundaries were loaded using the read_sf() function and filtered to include the towns of Hancock, Nelson, Peterborough, and Keene, where amphibian data was collected. A map highlighting these towns was created using ggplot(), with the full state map shown in light gray and the towns of interest marked in red. Labels were added to identify the selected towns, and a minimalistic theme was applied to remove extraneous elements, providing a clear representation of the study area.
Amphibian data, loaded from a CSV file, was cleaned by renaming columns for clarity (e.g., # Dead to Dead, # Crossed to Crossed, Town to TOWN, and Year to year). The cleaned data was merged with the filtered New Hampshire shapefile (nh_filtered) using a left join on the TOWN column, linking the amphibian data to the corresponding towns. The dataset was then filtered to retain only the relevant columns: TOWN, Dead, and town geometries.
Land use data was processed by first listing all TIFF files in the "NLCD" directory and filtering those containing "LndCov" in their filenames. The year was extracted from the filenames to create a new vector. A custom function, read_stars2, was defined to read, transform, and crop each land use file using the stars package, ensuring it matched the coordinate reference system of the New Hampshire data and was cropped to the state boundary. The function was applied to each land use dataset using lapply, and the datasets were named based on the extracted year information.
A CSV file containing a land cover legend was loaded, and the landuse column was converted into a factor. A custom function, join_dat, was defined to join the land use data with New Hampshire town boundaries, drop geometry information, and filter the data based on specific development categories. This function was applied to each land use dataset, and the results were combined into one dataframe (nh_lu_combined), which was filtered to remove any missing values.
The development index for each town and year was calculated by grouping the data by town and year, calculating the proportion of each land use category, and applying a score based on the legend. The logarithm of the sum of these scores, weighted by their proportions, formed the final development index for each town-year combination. The amphibian data was processed to ensure consistent year formatting, and the development index was merged with the amphibian data to create a final combined dataset (combined_data), which was filtered to remove missing values.
The analysis involved several statistical techniques to understand the influence of urbanization on amphibian road crossings and mortality. Trends in amphibian mortality rates across years were explored by calculating the ratio of dead to crossed amphibians, with the data differentiated by species. A line graph was created to show how mortality rates changed over time, highlighting the impact of road crossings on amphibian populations.
A random forest model was constructed using the development index (a measure of urbanization), year, species, and town as predictors for the number of amphibian road crossings. This model assessed the relative importance of each predictor in explaining amphibian mortality across towns, with the variable importance plot showing the development index and species as key contributors.
A linear regression model was used to explore the relationship between urbanization and amphibian crossings, incorporating the development index, year, and town as predictors. An interaction term between the development index and year was added to investigate how the effect of urbanization on amphibian crossings may vary over time. The interaction plot illustrated how the development index influenced road crossings differently across years.
To provide a more detailed understanding of town-specific urbanization patterns, the development index trends for Keene, Hancock, Nelson, and Peterborough were examined over time. Graphs for each town were created to show the relationship between the development index and time.
Finally, the random forest model was applied again to assess the importance of the development index, year, town, and species on amphibian road crossings. The resulting variable importance plot refined the understanding of the factors influencing amphibian mortality and road crossing behavior.

# Results 



### Spatial Distribution of Amphibian Mortality 

To assess whether amphibian mortality from road crossing is spatially autocorrelated, we produced a map of amphibians dead across Hancock, Peterborough, Nelson, and Keene in New Hampshire.

The color gradient indicates the varying number of mortalities, with darker shades representing higher counts. Town names are labeled for reference."}

  ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = Dead)) +
  geom_sf_text(aes(label = TOWN), size = 3, color = "black", check_overlap = TRUE) +
  labs(
    title = "Amphibian Mortality Across New Hampshire", 
    subtitle = "Count of dead amphibians observed due to road crossings"
  ) +
  scale_fill_gradient(
    name = "Count of Dead Amphibians", 
    limits = c(0, 150),

    high = "darkblue", 
    na.value = "grey50"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()


mapview(nh_amphibian, zcol="Dead")

```




### Mortality Trends Over Time 

Next, to assess trends in amphibian mortality rates from road crossings across multiple years, we plotted the mortality rates (calculated as the ratio of dead to crossed amphibians) for different species over time. This analysis allows us to explore whether mortality rates have changed over the years, potentially indicating the influence of urbanization on amphibian populations.

The graph illustrates how mortality rates have changed over time, providing insights into the impact of road crossings on amphibian populations. Higher mortality rates in certain years or species may indicate increased vulnerability, potentially influenced by urbanization."}

combined_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = Dead / Crossed, color = Species)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Amphibian Mortality Rates Over Time", 
       x = "Year", y = "Mortality Rate") +
  theme_minimal()
```



### Predicting Amphibian Crossing Mortality Based on Land Use: Random Forest and Linear Models


To explore the influence of urbanization and other variables on amphibian road crossings, we constructed a random forest model using the development index (dev_index), year, species, and town as predictors for the number of road crossings (Crossed). The model allows us to assess the relative importance of each predictor in explaining amphibian mortality across towns.

```{r, random forest model, message = F, echo = F, warning=F, fig.cap = "Variable Importance Plot from Random Forest Model. This plot displays the importance of each predictor variable in the random forest model used to assess the factors influencing amphibian road crossings. The predictors include the development index (dev_index), year, town (TOWN), and species. Higher importance values indicate greater influence on predicting amphibian mortality due to road crossings, with the development index and species showing notable contributions."}

rf_model <- randomForest(Crossed ~ dev_index + year + TOWN + Species, data = combined_data, importance = TRUE)
varImpPlot(rf_model)
```




Building on these findings, we then performed a linear regression analysis to further explore how urbanization, along with other variables, directly impacts amphibian road crossings. The linear model allowed us to assess the strength and significance of these predictors in explaining the variation in amphibian crossings across years and towns.

```{r, analyze results linear models, message = F, echo = F, warning=F, fig.cap="This figure presents the results of a linear regression analysis testing the relationship between amphibian road crossings (Crossed) and predictors including the development index (dev_index), year, and town (TOWN). The model helps assess how urbanization, represented by the development index, influences amphibian crossings over time and across different towns."}

lm_result <- lm(Crossed ~ dev_index + year + TOWN, data = combined_data)
summary(lm_result)
```




### Understanding Temporal Interactions and Town-Specific Development Trends

To further investigate the interaction between urbanization and time by including an interaction term between the development index and year in the model. This allowed us to investigate how the effect of urbanization on amphibian road crossings may vary over time. The following figure presents the interaction between the development index and year, providing insights into how urbanization’s impact on amphibian crossings changes across different years.

```{r, interaction, message = F, echo = F, warning=F, fig.cap="This figure visualizes the interaction between the development index (dev_index) and year in influencing amphibian road crossings. The linear model suggests that the effect of urbanization on amphibian crossings may change over time, with the development index’s influence potentially varying across years. This highlights how urbanization’s impact on amphibian crossings might be stronger or weaker in different years."}

lm_result_interaction <- lm(Crossed ~ dev_index * year + TOWN, data = combined_data)

ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = year, y = Crossed, color = dev_index)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", aes(group = dev_index)) +
  labs(title = "Effect of Development Index Over Time on Amphibian Crossings", 
       x = "Year", y = "Number of Crossed Amphibians")
```





Finally, after examining the broader trends of urbanization’s influence on amphibian crossings, we focused on the individual towns of Keene, Hancock, Nelson, and Peterborough to explore how their development index has evolved over time. This allows for a more detailed understanding of the town-specific urbanization patterns that might influence amphibian crossings
