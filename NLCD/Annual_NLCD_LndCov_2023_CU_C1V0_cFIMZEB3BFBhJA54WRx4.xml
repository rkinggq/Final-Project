      <abstract>The USGS Land Cover program has combined the tried-and-true methodologies from premier land cover projects, National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP), together with modern innovations in geospatial deep learning technologies to create the next generation of land cover and land change information. The product suite is called, “Annual NLCD” and includes six annual products that represent land cover and surface change characteristics of the U.S.:

  1) Land Cover,
  2) Land Cover Change,
  3) Land Cover Confidence,
  4) Fractional Impervious Surface,
  5) Impervious Descriptor, and
  6) Spectral Change Day of Year.

These land cover science product algorithms harness the remotely sensed Landsat data record to provide state-of-the-art land surface change information needed by scientists, resource managers, and decision-makers. Annual NLCD uses a modernized, integrated approach to map, monitor, synthesize, and understand the complexities of land use, cover, and condition change. With this first release, Annual NLCD, Collection 1.0, the six products are available for the Conterminous U.S. for 1985 – 2023. 
        
Questions about the Annual NLCD product suite can be directed to the Annual NLCD mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or custserv@usgs.gov. See included spatial metadata for more details.</abstract>
      <purpose>The goal of this project is to provide the Nation with complete, current, and consistent public domain information on its land use and land cover.</purpose>

        <procdesc>Time Series

The Landsat STAC-server is queried for all observations in a specific Landsat Collection 2 ARD tile. The surface reflectance, brightness temperature, and pixel quality layers are then accessed from Landsat cloud storage and placed in a time series optimized Zarr array to efficiently support downstream operations.
        </procdesc>
        <procdate>2024</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Continuous Change Detection

Surface reflectance, brightness temperature, and pixel quality information is read in from a time series optimized Zarr array for a given tile. This data is then processed through the Band First Probability (BFP) Continuous Change Detection (CCD) algorithm, with the results stored as parquet files within cloud data stores.

        <procdate>2024</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Leaf-On Annual Composites

Surface reflectance and pixel quality information is read from the Landsat Collection 2 ARD cloud archive stores for a given year and tile. The data is then passed to the compositing algorithm, with additional data for neighboring years gathered as needed. Results are stored as 6 band geotiffs within cloud data stores.

        <procdate>2024</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Leaf-Off Annual Synthetics

BFP CCD parquet results are read in for a given tile and surface reflectance predictions are calculated based on the harmonic coefficients for corresponding years. Results are stored as 6 band geotiffs within cloud data stores.

        <procdate>2024</procdate>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Land Cover Classification Training

Landsat Collection 1 ARD based leaf-on composites, leaf-off synthetics, digital elevation model (DEM), DEM slope, DEM positional index, DEM aspect, wetlands potential index (WPI), NLCD 2021, and LCMAP 1.3 CCD results are processed through the LCAMS algorithm using high performance/throughput computing architectures. The resulting models are then transitioned to cloud storage.

        <procdate>2024</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Land Cover Classification Prediction

Leaf-on composites, leaf-off synthetics, and BFP CCD results are access from cloud storage and passed to the LCAMS algorithm. Spatial and refined soft max values are stored as Zarr arrays in cloud storage.
</procdesc>
        <procdate>2024</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Impervious Classification Training

Landsat Collection 1 ARD based leaf-on composites, leaf-off synthetics, NLCD 2021 science product, NLCD 2021 impervious descriptor, and the DEM are processed through the LCAMS algorithm using HPC/HTC computing architectures. The resulting models are transitioned to cloud storage.

        <procdate>2024</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Impervious Classification Prediction

Leaf-on composites, leaf-off synthetics, and the trained impervious model are read in and passed to the LCAMS algorithm with results being stored as Zarr arrays in cloud storage.
        </procdesc>
        <procdate>2024</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Post Classification

Spatial, refined, and impervious probabilities are joined with BFP CCD results to pass through the different post classification methodologies. These steps include the STIPP method and various expert informed heuristics to identify and mitigate potential issues with any singular set of prediction probabilities. Product values are stored as intermediate tiff files.
        </procdesc>
        <procdate>2024</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Product Generation

Intermediate product tiff files are read from cloud storage with the final data formatting steps are applied to generate cloud optimized geotiffs (COG) and associated metadata.
